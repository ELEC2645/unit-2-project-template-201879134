ELEC2645 Unit 2 Project: Hack Computer Assembler and Disassembler by Esme Newman

This program is a basic assembler and disassembler for the Hack computer. 

Depending on the menu item you choose, it will ask you for binary or machine code and will output the translation into its opposite. 

Here are a few inputs you can test and the expected outputs:

Binary                        Machine language

1111110000010000      |       D=M         
0000000000010111      |       @23
1110101010000111      |       0;JMP
0100000000000000      |       @16384
1111110010011011      |       DM=M-1;JGE



I hope you enjoyed this project :)
